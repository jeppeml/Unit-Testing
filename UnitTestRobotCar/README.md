# UnitTestRobotCar
A small game for some unit testing

This is a crude little game, where you can control a robot in a simple game area.

1. Try to create a unit test for the RobotCar class. What is important to test? Is the class well documented?

2. Update the documentation of the RobotCar class, so that it reflects the test you have made. What does the method jump() actually do, and what is the property jumpPower doing?

3. Create your own RobotCar, but this one is special. This car can change color by pressing 'c' on the keyboard, and is controlled by "wasd" instead of the arrow keys. You must use inheritance for this purpose. You are allowed to refactor the original RobotCar class. Which problems did arise from this? How about the test?

4. Create a test class for a new class called flower. Do the test class BEFORE the actual flower class. A flower is stationary, so x and y values never change. Furthermore it is to be drawn as a small circle of random color. Refactor the controller, so that it draws 25 different flowers on the screen.

5. Try to refactor the program, so that it follows the rules of low coupling and high cohesion
